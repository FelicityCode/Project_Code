# Project_Code
Shared code from my project experience, most codes are from my independent work, if some are team works I will give a remark
The codes are categorized into different folders: 
- Practice: include weekly modelling practice while learning data science, usually using datasets from Kaggle or other data websites.
- Financial Projects: predictive modelling for specific financial problems, such as credit approval, fraud detection, etc.
- Commercial Projects: predictive modelling for a large variety of business problems, such as user retention, user reactivation, segmentation, etc.
